# Open Domain QA System With Document Clustering
The efficiency of QA system will mostly depend on the information retreival(IR) part, to improve the efficiency of IR part QA a combination of document clustering and TF-IDF similarity score is applied and which is followed by RoBERTa pre-trained model for the answer prediction.
 SQuAD V1 dataset is used for the project.
